Hi Elvis!

I pretty much have finished my part and have tested several cases.

Now it's your turn! Good luck!

Please look at my function invalid() to make use of that. Apart from invalid(),
you should be able to just use getValues() and never worry my implementation.

If you are interested in my implementation, that's fine because I have commented
as much as I can. If you find anything confusing, please let me know!

In addition, I have uploaded the data file in hw3 and a small test file.

Have a good weekend!
